# CalDAV Sync

Code that syncs tasks from various sources into CalDAV.

Current sources:

- Ejlur for homework
- Bitrix24 for work
- Ozon orders

There is a config example in `config.example.toml`, and you may try to adapt this
for yourself, but this is a personal script so there's no support or documentation.
